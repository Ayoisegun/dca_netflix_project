# dca_netflix_project
This is a containerized data pipeline for ingesting, preprocessing, and analyzing Netflix titles data.  The aim of this project is to transform raw CSV data on Netflix titles into a structured PostgreSQL database to enable analysis of content over time, such as the ratio of Movies to TV Shows or the most common TV categories.
